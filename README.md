# SPOTIFY-MUSIC-STREAM-ANALYSIS
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
My first Excel project. This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Spotify’s music streaming trends in 2023, highlighting key insights and strategic recommendations to enhance platform engagement and profitability.

### TOOLS USED
MS Excel, Pivot Tables, Power Query, Power BI

## KEY INSIGHTS:
- **Peak Streaming Months:** January recorded the highest streaming activity with **97 billion streams**, marking a strong listener engagement at the year's start. May also saw significant numbers **(53 billion streams)**, while streams dipped between June and August, with April hitting the lowest count at **27 billion**. A slight recovery was observed in **November (44 billion)** and **December (28 billion)**.

- **Top-Performing Tracks:** Blinding Lights led as the most-streamed song, accumulating **3.7 billion streams**, closely followed by Shape of You with **3.6 billion streams** —both proving to be timeless hits with enduring appeal.

- **Leading Artists:** The Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, and Taylor Swift each amassed **14 billion streams**, showcasing close competition among top-tier artists. Meanwhile, Harry Styles and Bad Bunny also maintained strong streaming figures with **12 billion** and **10 billion streams**, respectively.

## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS:

- **Capitalize on Peak Streaming Months:** With engagement spiking in **January and May**, Spotify could maximize impact through promotional campaigns, exclusive releases, or platform-wide events during these months. Additionally, addressing the mid-year dip (June–August) with **summer-themed playlists, exclusive content, or seasonal promotions** could help sustain listener activity.

- **Leverage Evergreen Hits:** Given the long-term success of tracks like Blinding Lights and Shape of You, Spotify could introduce curated **"All-Time Hits" or "Evergreen Favorites"** playlists to engage users and extend the lifespan of these high-performing songs.

- **Diversify Artist Exposure:** While top artists dominate streaming, introducing **emerging artists through curated playlists, "Artist of the Month" features, or algorithm-driven recommendations** could enrich user experience and promote new music discovery.

By implementing these strategies, Spotify can **enhance user engagement, sustain high streaming volumes, and boost overall profitability** in the evolving music landscape.
